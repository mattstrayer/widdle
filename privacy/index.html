		<p>Please review this Privacy Policy before using the Widdle application (the “App”).</p>
		<p>By using or accessing this App you signify your acknowledgment and assent to the Privacy Policy set forth below. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the App. This policy is intended to help you understand how Widdle LLC ("Widdle" "we," or "us") collect, use and shares the information you provide on our App.</p>
		<h1>What we collect</h1>
		<p>We aggregate both anonymous and personal data. What we collect depends on what you do when you use our App and on what personal information you elect to give us.  When you connect your social media accounts, certain information from those accounts is made available to us.  This information can include your profile information as well as user content.</p>
		<h1>Anonymous data</h1>
		<p>We collect anonymous data when you use the App, including, but not limited to, your    e-mail address, the time of your visit, and the activity that takes place while you use the App. We use this information to monitor and improve the performance of our App so that we can continue to effectively and reliably provide useful services for our visitors, Widdle and our partners. </p>
		<h1>Personal Information</h1>
		<p>If you wish, you can provide us with personal information about yourself.. This information includes your [name, email address, phone number and credit card information]. We only collect this information directly from you and only when you elect to provide it. Depending upon which of our services you are using, the types of non-public personal information that we may collect include: 
	Name, postal address, email address, and telephone number;
Information we receive from you on applications, forms and in other communications  to us, whether in writing, in person, by telephone or by any other means; 
Information about your transactions with us, our partners, or others;
Information from your usage of the App; and
Information we receive from your device when you visit our App that is unique to your device. 
		</p>
		<h1>Profile</h1>
		<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, or clear gifs to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users' personally identifiable information to provide information and improve the content of the App for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our App, and to direct pertinent information to them.</p>
		<h1>Analytics Information</h1>
		<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the App. These tools collect information sent by your device or our App, including the posts you “widdle”, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the App. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.</p>
		<h1>Sharing of your information</h1>
		<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Widdle without your consent, except as noted in this Privacy Policy.  We may share your information and user content (including, but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and usage data) with third parties.</p>
		<h1>What we use</h1>
		<h1>Cookies</h1>
		<p>We may use cookies. Web cookies are small bits of information that your web browser may allow our server to store on your device. We use this information to anonymously track your visit to our App. Even if you elect to give us personal information, it will never appear in the cookies. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookies, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. You can disable cookies (consult support information from your browser's publisher). If you disable cookies, your visit to our App will not be significantly affected though, from time to time, we may provide special features that require the use of cookies.</p>
		<h1>Web Beacons (Clear Gifs)</h1>
		<p>Our App may also contain electronic images known as web beacons, or clear gif technology, that can be used to assist in determining what content is effective on the App. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons are not used to access your personal information. They are a technique used to compile aggregate statistics about usage of a App. Web beacons collect a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Clear gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same App or web marketing/customer service company. That means, for example that if a person viewed "www.companyX.com", which uses a web marketing company's clear gif, the App or web marketing company would match the clear gif's identifier and the web marketing company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the App. In addition, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications.</p>
		<h1>Device Identifiers</h1>
		<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our App, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Widdle.</p>
		<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the App and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the App may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
		<h1>Log Files</h1>
		<p>Like most standard App servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the App, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our web-based service.</p>
		<h1>How long we keep your user content</h1>
		<p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, Widdle, its affiliates, or its service providers may retain information and user content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.  If you have any questions about termination or deactivation of your account, please contact us directly at the contact information listed below.</p>
		<h1>Children's Privacy</h1>
		<p>We believe that protecting the privacy of children is very important. Our App is not designed to attract individuals under the age of 13. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect or store personal information about children under the age of 13.  If we discover we have received any personal information from a child under the age of 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe that Widdle has any information from or about anyone under the age of 13,please contact us at the contact points specified below.</p>
		<h1>Linked Apps</h1>
		<p>Our App may contain links to various other websites. Widdle assumes no responsibility
for the content or practices of websites linked through our App and such linking should not suggest or imply any affiliation or endorsement by Widdle of the linked website. Please be aware that we, Widdle, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other Apps. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our App and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this App.</p>
		<h1>Opt-out of certain communications</h1>
		<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by contacting us at the contact points specified below.</p>
		<h1>Security</h1>
		<p>We follow industry standards and practices to safeguard all of the information, anonymous and personal, that we collect. If users have any questions about the security of our App, users can contact us at the contact points specified below.</p>
		<h1>Revisions to this policy</h1>
		<p>Widdle reserves the right to periodically revise this policy. Please check this page periodically for changes. The document revision date displayed below will indicate when this policy was last revised. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our App notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
